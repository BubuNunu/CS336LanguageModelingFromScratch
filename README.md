With experience in Python, RNNs, NLP, and Transformers, Iâ€™m following this Stanford open course to deepen my understanding of language models and identify areas for further improvement.

ðŸ“˜ I will upload all the assignments here to document my learning journey and connect with peers for discussion and collaboration.

## ðŸ§± First Class: Tokenization

### ðŸ”„ String to Tokens (Indices)

**Methods of Tokenization:**
- **Character-level**:  
  - Small tokens  
  - Longer sequences  
- **Word-level**:  
  - Larger tokens  
  - Shorter sequences  
- **BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)**:  
  - A subword-level method that balances vocabulary size and sequence length
